Tools and Libraries: LangChain, HuggingFace, FAISS for vector store, all-MiniLM-l6-v2 for embedding model, Intel/dynamic_tinybert for Q&A Chatbot LLM.

Due to depreciation of RetrievalQA code will result in Value error but will still give relevent answer. See link for RetrievalQA migration https://python.langchain.com/docs/versions/migrating_chains/retrieval_qa/
